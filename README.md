# Alcohol-Drug Deaths

This project contains code and files to clean VRBIS data, merge VBRIS data with multiple cause of death files (if needed) and to get drug and alcohol numbers for CSTE metrics

All of the files are in R markdown and should be pasted into R markdown to run. 

Common acronyms used:

MCOD -> multiple cause of death; refers to the files that store MCOD data in them. Starting in 2016, these are already in BVRBIS files, but before, they are separate and need to be merged with VRBIS to get multiple cause codes for VRBIS deaths
